### This file will explain the purpose and the setup for this system.

## The Goal

The goal of this application is to provide a framework where students can connect with the alumni of their school through
internships, mentorships, and events. The backend to the system will keep track of all users and their statuses - whether
it be alumni or student. Alumni will be invited to post opportunities of mentorships or internships for the students that
are following in their path. Students will be able to view these opportunities and be able to inquiry about the posted
positions.

The hope of this system is to bring a school together by bringing together the students of present and the students of past.
